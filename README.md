# Personal-Projects

Welcome to my Personal Projects repository! 

This repository contains personal projects that I have implemented outside of the classroom and on my own time

Personal Project 1 - I was able to self develop and implement a Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++ programming language. (Pre-Note: Dijkstra's Algorithm is an Algorthim that finds the shortest path between two nodes). I was fascinated with this algorthim becuase it efficiently solves a complex problem and provides an elegant solution.

Personal Project 2 - I wouldn't say that I am a math nerd but in this personal project I was able to self implement the (Gaussian elimination) which is something that I learned when I was in Linear Algebra.

Personal Project 3 - This project revolves around leveraging the principles acquired from CSCI 3240 (Intro to Computer Systems) to create a Blockbuster movie database. This database will incorporate concurrent programming, enabling simultaneous interactions for multiple Blockbuster employees. Through this implementation, employees can seamlessly edit the database, process rental requests, and manage returns, ensuring efficient and concurrent operations within the Blockbuster system.
