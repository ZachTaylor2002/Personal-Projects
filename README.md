# Personal-Projects

Welcome to my Personal Projects repository! 

This repository contains personal projects that I have implemented outside of the classroom and on my own time

Personal Project 1 - I was able to self develop and implement a Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++ programming language. (Pre-Note: Dijkstra's Algorithm is an Algorthim that finds the shortest path between two nodes). I was fascinated with this algorthim becuase it efficiently solves a complex problem and provides an elegant solution.

Personal Project 2 - I wouldn't say that I am a math nerd but in this personal project I was able to self implement the (Gaussian elimination) which is something that I learned when I was in Linear Algebra.
